          <h3>Street art</h3>
          Street art is a form of artwork that is displayed in public on
          surrounding buildings, on streets, trains, and on other publicly
          viewed surfaces. Many instances come in the form of guerrilla art,
          which is intended to make a personal statement about the society that
          the artist lives within. The work has moved from the beginnings of
          graffiti and vandalism to new modes where artists work to bring
          messages, or just beauty, to an audience. <br />

          Some artists may use "smart vandalism" as a way to raise awareness of
          social and political issues,whereas other artists use urban space as
          an opportunity to display personal artwork. Artists may also
          appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with
          installing illicit artwork in public places. A common motive is that
          creating art in a format that utilizes public space allows artists who
          may otherwise feel disenfranchised to reach a much broader audience
          than other styles or galleries would allow. <br />

          Whereas traditional graffiti artists have primarily used spray paint
          to produce their work, "street art" can encompass other media, such as
          LED art, mosaic tiling, stencil art, sticker art, reverse graffiti,
          "Lock On" sculptures, wheatpasting, woodblocking, yarn bombing, and
          rock balancing.[5] New media forms such as video projections onto
          large city buildings are an increasingly popular tool for street
          artists—and the availability of cheap hardware and software allows
          such artwork to become competitive with corporate advertisements.
          Artists are thus able to create art from their personal computers for
          free, which competes with companies' profits.
